# Selection_of_Low_Frequency_Extensions_of_Saturn_Kilometric_Radiation
Code that corresponds to paper published in PRE IV Proceedings.<br />
Configurations file contains three filepaths; input_data_fp (where you store the data needed to run the code), output_data_fp (where you store the data that will be generated by the code) and figures (where you store the figures generated by the code).
### script1_load_trajectory_data.py
Interpolates trajectory data to the same time resolution as the radio data.
### script2_bin_flux_by_location.py
Bins the flux density data across the whole mission according to local time and latitude bins specified in the paper.
### script3_find_nonlfe_intervals.py
Find the intervals of 'nonlfe' emission outlined in the paper.
### script4_plot_class_examples.py
Makes figure (2) from paper, plot of dynamic spectrum of each LFE class.
### script5_make_5panel_traj_plot
Makes figure (3) from paper of spacecraft trajectory with LFE intervals overplotted.
